Here's a concrete plan you can input into your build assistant (cursor) to get started:

---

## Project: Voice-Activated Cooking Assistant Web Demo

### **Overview**
Build a web app that accepts a plain-text recipe, parses it into a structured format, and then guides the user through the cooking process using voice interactions. The app will support:
- Interactive Q&A (e.g., "What's the next step?")
- Step-by-step voice guidance via TTS (using ElevenLabs)
- Timers/reminders for time-bound steps (e.g., "caramelize onions for 10 minutes")
- Image capture for real-time food assessment (e.g., checking if onions are caramelized)

### **Core Functionalities**
1. **Recipe Parsing & Structuring**
   - **Input:** Plain-text recipe or webpage URL
   - **Processing:** 
     - For plain text: Use Mistral's NLP capabilities
     - For URLs: Scrape webpage content and extract recipe data
     - Support major recipe websites (AllRecipes, Food Network, NYT Cooking, etc.)
   - **Output:** A structured JSON format
   - **Validation:** Add input validation and error handling for:
     - Malformed recipes
     - Invalid URLs
     - Blocked/failed webpage scraping
   - **Format Support:** 
     - Add support for common recipe formats and schema.org Recipe markup
     - Handle recipe websites' specific HTML structures
     - Extract recipe data from unstructured blog posts
   
2. **Interactive Q&A Module**
   - **Function:** Answer user questions related to the recipe and provide cooking assistance
   - **Implementation:** 
     - Use Mistral LLM as the primary query handler
     - Structure prompts to include:
       - Current recipe context
       - User's cooking history and preferences
       - Previous steps and actions taken
       - Common cooking knowledge
     - Cache frequent responses for performance
   - **Query Types:**
     - Recipe-specific questions (e.g., "How many eggs do I need?")
     - Navigation commands (e.g., "What's the next step?")
     - Ingredient substitutions (e.g., "Can I use margarine instead of butter?")
     - Troubleshooting help (e.g., "I added too much salt")
     - Technique explanations (e.g., "How do I fold in ingredients?")
   - **Knowledge Integration:**
     - Provide Mistral with structured cooking knowledge:
       ```json
       {
         "context": {
           "recipe": {
             "current_step": "Saut√© onions until translucent",
             "progress": "4/10 steps completed",
             "active_timers": ["onions: 5 mins remaining"]
           },
           "user": {
             "skill_level": "beginner",
             "dietary_restrictions": ["dairy-free"],
             "available_equipment": ["stove", "oven", "blender"]
           }
         },
         "reference_data": {
           "substitutions": {
             "common_pairs": {...},
             "dietary_alternatives": {...}
           },
           "troubleshooting": {
             "common_issues": {...},
             "emergency_fixes": {...}
           }
         }
       }
       ```
   - **Prompt Engineering:**
     - Format: "Given {context} and {reference_data}, help user with: {query}"
     - Include safety constraints and cooking best practices
     - Maintain conversation history for context
   - **Context Awareness:** 
     - Track current step and previous actions
     - Remember user's dietary restrictions
     - Consider equipment limitations
   - **Fallback Mechanisms:**
     - Use structured responses for common queries
     - Fall back to general cooking principles
     - Clearly indicate when advice is generalized
     - Suggest seeking professional help for safety concerns

3. **Step-by-Step Guidance with TTS**
   - **Function:** Read out recipe steps using natural-sounding voices.
   - **Integration:** Call the ElevenLabs TTS API to generate audio instructions.
   - **User Commands:** Support commands like "next," "repeat," or "previous."
   - **Offline Support:** Cache commonly used audio instructions
   - **Voice Selection:** Allow users to choose from available voices
   - **Speed Control:** Support adjustable playback speed
   - **Emergency Commands:** Support "stop" and "pause" commands

4. **Timer & Reminder Functionality**
   - **Function:** For steps with specific time instructions, trigger a timer and then notify the user via a voice prompt.
   - **Implementation:** Use JavaScript timers (`setTimeout`) and the Web Notifications API or TTS output for reminders.
   - **Multiple Timers:** Support concurrent timers for complex recipes
   - **Background Operation:** Ensure timers work when device is locked
   - **Persistent Storage:** Save timer state in case of page refresh
   - **Audio Options:** Configurable timer sounds

5. **Image Capture & Food Assessment**
   - **Function:** Allow users to take a photo (via the device camera) to assess if a cooking step is complete.
   - **Integration:** Use the HTML5 `getUserMedia` API for image capture, and send the image to a backend endpoint where an ML model (using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or AWS Rekognition) analyzes the food doneness.
   - **Feedback:** Return results that are then read out via TTS.
   - **Progressive Enhancement:** Fallback text instructions when camera unavailable
   - **Image Guidelines:** Show reference images for comparison
   - **Local Processing:** Use TensorFlow.js for basic checks client-side
   - **Privacy:** Clear option to disable/enable camera features

6. **Recipe Search & Suggestions**
   - **Function:** Allow users to search for recipes and get personalized suggestions
   - **Implementation:**
     - Natural language recipe search (e.g., "show me quick pasta dishes")
     - Filter by ingredients, cuisine, dietary restrictions, cooking time
     - Save favorite recipes and cooking history
   - **Data Sources:**
     - Integration with recipe APIs (Spoonacular, Edamam, etc.)
     - User-contributed recipes database
     - Ability to import recipes from popular cooking websites
   - **Smart Suggestions:**
     - Based on user preferences and past cooking history
     - Seasonal recipe recommendations
     - Dietary restrictions awareness
     - Pantry-based suggestions (what can I cook with what I have?)

### **Architecture & Workflow**
1. **Recipe Input:**  
   The user can:
   - Input/paste a plain-text recipe
   - Paste a URL to a recipe webpage
   - Import from supported recipe websites via browser extension
2. **URL Processing (new):**
   ```json
   {
     "url_processor": {
       "supported_domains": [
         "allrecipes.com",
         "foodnetwork.com",
         "epicurious.com",
         "cooking.nytimes.com"
       ],
       "extraction_methods": {
         "schema_org": "Parse schema.org/Recipe markup",
         "site_specific": "Use site-specific selectors",
         "fallback": "Use ML-based content extraction"
       },
       "error_handling": {
         "blocked": "Suggest manual copy-paste",
         "paywall": "Request user authentication",
         "not_found": "Validate URL and retry"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Parsing:**  
   The backend (FastAPI) processes the text with Mistral to generate a JSON object:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Spaghetti Bolognese",
     "metadata": {
       "servings": 4,
       "prepTime": "15 minutes",
       "cookTime": "45 minutes",
       "difficulty": "medium"
     },
     "ingredients": [
       {
         "item": "spaghetti",
         "amount": 400,
         "unit": "g",
         "notes": "dried"
       }
     ],
     "steps": [
       {
         "step": 1,
         "instruction": "Boil water and cook spaghetti for 10 minutes.",
         "timer": {
           "duration": 600,
           "type": "cooking"
         },
         "checkpoints": ["water boiling", "pasta al dente"]
       }
     ],
     "equipment": [
       "large pot",
       "colander"
     ]
   }
   ```
4. **Guidance:**  
   The app reads out step 1 using ElevenLabs TTS.  
   The user can use voice commands (via the Web Speech API) to navigate: "next," "repeat," etc.
5. **Timer & Reminder:**  
   For time-bound steps, a timer is set in the frontend. When time's up, the app notifies the user (via TTS or a notification).
6. **Image Capture & Assessment:**  
   The user takes a photo using `getUserMedia`.  
   The image is sent to the backend for analysis (using a pre-trained ML model) to determine if the food is cooked properly, and feedback is provided.
